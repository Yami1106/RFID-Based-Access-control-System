## RFID-Based Access Control System

**Empowering Secure Entry with Wireless Identification Technology**

<p>Introducing a robust and user-friendly access control system built on the power of RFID (Radio-frequency identification) technology. This Arduino-powered project grants authorized access with a simple scan and deters unwanted entries with instant visual and audio feedback.</p>

**Features:**

* **Touchless Convenience:** Scan your authorized RFID tag or card for effortless entry.
* **Visual Confirmation:** Green LED and "Access Granted" message on the LCD display validate authorized access.
* **Auditory Alert:** Red LED and buzzer combination instantly deter unauthorized attempts.
* **Customizable Security:** Define the authorized RFID IDs in the code for complete control.
* **Clear Guidance:** LCD prompts like "Present Tag" guide users for seamless operation.
* **Compact and Efficient:** Arduino platform offers a cost-effective and portable solution.

**Applications:**

* Secure home or office entry points
* Restricted access to labs, workshops, or storage areas
* Event management and guest registration
* Time and attendance monitoring

**Get Started (Step-by-Step Guide):**

1. **Hardware:** Gather the required components and follow the wiring instructions in the Arduino code along with the pin diagram.
2. **Software:** Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Uno board.
3. **Customization:** Update the `accessID` variable in the code with your authorized tags/cards.
4. **Deployment:** Mount the system securely at your desired access point.
